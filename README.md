Immutable is an Australian-based start up that began its operations in 2018 and has seen huge success in both domestic and offshore markets. Started by two brothers, Robbie and James Ferguson and friend Alex Connolly, the company began as a decentralised game designer that has gone on to become the leading global back-end for trading non-fungible tokens. The company first developed its first and now the highest grossing blockchain-backed video game, Gods Unchained, in 2018 where users "would trade and sell their cards freely, with the same level of ownership as if they were real tangible cards". [^1] [^9] [^2]
Having seen huge success of this game and other Immutable developed games, Immutable somewhat pivoted their focus and saw the need to firstly develop a marketplace to trade their game-oriented NFT's and other NFT projects and consequently develop out further Layer 2 Protocol on the Ethereum network to scale Ethereum projects. With the rise of Ethereum and gas fees which ultimately slowed down secondary trading in this space, the company has gone on to become the world leader in Layer 2 Protocol of the Ethereum network, developing solutions to efficiently handle transactions and reduce gas and transaction times.[^8] 
Since its inception, Immutable has received large rounds funding from multiple Venture Capital funds and investors looking to develop web3 capabilities in Australia and overseas. Initial seed capital of $2.4 million from blockchain-focussed venture capital funds, Continue Capital and Nirvana Capital, helped the company develop out their first project and second round of funding in September 2019 saw blockchain focussed VC firms Galaxy Digital EOS VC fund and Nasper Ventures commit $15 million to support further development of their flagship game. Since their development of their own open-source blockchain platform, Immutable X, and it's linked Layer 2 Protocol software, the company has seen larger funding in the last 6 months of $82 million (Sept 2021) and $200 million (Mar 2022) from lead investors backed by Tencent, GameStop and other VC firms.[^3]

# Business Activities and Company Landscape
Ethereum is the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency and has gained popularity due to its compatibility with developer's projects. Despite this, it's compatibility for smart contracts, dApps and speed in which it can verify contracts, it still exhibits some major problems which Immutable are looking to solve. These issues include high gas fees, high requirements of electricity to validate transactions and ultimately network congestion which is slowing down the execution of smart contracts which Ethereum is known for. While at first glance, Immutable X's website looks like it is just another marketplace, similar to the likes of OpenSea, it is their Layer 2 scaling solution that can link with project is in place to ultimately support developers to mint projects and make secondary transacting more efficient than running NFT projects directly on Ethereum. Immutable was the first to develop a Layer 2 scaling solution for NFTs on the Ethereum Network and this project was developed to solve this specific issue, promising zero gas fees for peer to peer trading, increased scalability with 9,000 trades per second, and ensuring all transactions are 100% carbon neutral. [^10] [^8]
The type of Layer 2 solution Immutable pioneered is called zero-knowledge roll up or ZK-rollups, which essentially the process of collateralising data on the main chain, that is then transported off-chain for processing and computing. ZK-rollups use validity proof to instantly determine if the transactions are valid or not. As data is stored off-chain and relevant data is requested less frequently, it saves considerable amounts of processing power and frees up the blockchain capacity used for transaction validation. [^5]
There is only one other competitor in this space who do this form of Layer 2 protocol in zkSync which are more focussed on the development of dApps. However, having only released their product in Q3 2020, and due to the complexity of ZK-rollups, haven't been able to create efficiencies as great as Immutable. Their transaction speeds are much slower (up to 10 minutes) and still require some gas fees albeit very low. Other companies in the Layer 2 Protocol space include Arbitrum and Optimism which use optimistic rollup. Optimistic rollups, contrary to ZK-rollups, assume transactions are valid until proven otherwise. Optimistic rollups process ten time less transactions as ZK-rollups, are considerably slower as validation occurs off-chain and cannot be scalable to the degree ZK-rollups can be. [^16] [^4] [^17]
It is also worth noting as well that sidechains like polygon exist in this space as they aim to combat scalability issues with mainchain cryptocurrencies although are not considered to be Layer 2 as they essentially copy nodes from the mainchain to verify the data to relieve on-chain processing.

## Results and outlook of of Immutable and its Landscape
Since it's inception, Immutable have become the largest ZK-rollup provider in the world and one of the predominant Layer 2 solutions available. One of their main metrics used by Immutable is secondary market trading voume on their platform. Since inception, they have completed 200 million in secondary trading volume and are looking to increase this over the next 12 months to 1.2 billion in trading volume. In order to reach this target, the company have done a lot in attracting strategic partners where their technology can be implimented, such as GameStop, where Immutable are developing an NFT marketplace with their Layer 2 functionality, as well as partnership arrangements with Universal Studios, musicians such as Travis Scott and a large list of other big gaming companies and high-touch corporates. [^18] [^13] 
Immutable have come a long way since their inception especially since they've only being around for 4 years. Their future is relatively uncertain as this space is chainging rapidly making the next 5-10 years hard to predict. The company is looking to capitalise in the short term by adding to their strategic partners and continuing to develop their existing projects. 
Despite all this, there are many variables are at play which will impact the company and it's project's long-term success. Over the short-term, Immutable are looking to add significant partners over the next couple of years, having announced recently that GameStop will partner with Immutable to launch an NFT marketplace for video game assets to help fuel secondary transacting. With a recent study by PwC suggesting that the global economic output for virtual reality gaming will reach $1.5 million by 2030, this will sure benefit the long-run success of Immutable. [^6]
Further to this, Immutable aren't looking at slowing down with the company looking to hire an addition 200 staff over the next 12 months suggesting that there is potentially some big projects installed. This will be important in a space that is evolving at a rapid pace. Major Fortune 500 companies are also showing their attention in this space with the obvious company being Meta which are to release a "Metaverse" for gaming, trading digital assets and other virtual activities.

## Recommendations
It's fair to say that the NFT space has seen a boom as of late with its initial adoption and use of the a new technology, blockchain, being used in this brand new space. Similar to the dot com boom in the early 2000s, the hype from the early adoption of a new technology produces significant hype. With internet stocks, it was easy to measure this hype through the sharp rise of IT and internet companies stock prices in a relatively transparent market. A recent article written by Forbes this month suggesting the interest in NFT's and metaverses are declining based on internet searches which suggests we are approaching the end of NFT's initial hype[^7].  Does this mean NFT's and the need for Layer 2 protocol is going away? Not likely. If anything, like Facebook and Amazon to the dot com bubble, will see major growth and aggregating of FinTech companies. 
With a clear edge over any competitors in this space, Immutable are in a strong position to be one of these companies, but have a long way to go in order to become one of these companies. 
To gain a further grasp of this space in the long-term, I would recommend Immutable to consider further continue to develop out their current project in order to remain dominant in the space. As this space is constantly evolving, they should not focus so much on gaining strategic partners to use their current technology and instead further invest in research and development and stay ahead of futher advances in the space. 
In addition to this, Immutable's solutions are only currently available on the Ethereum network. There are a number of cryptocurrencies gaining popularity for their development capabilities which could see the same issues that Ethereum are currently experiencing. Cryptos such as MANA used for Decentraland and SAND for Sandbox which are both functioning metaverses are already beginning to experience the same issues as they begin to see large scale adoption. By developing a solution for these metaverses, Immutable can help further scale to assist in the scalability of these projects. Immutable could also span to assist non developer orientated coins such as bitcoin. Since bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency based on market cap and transaction frequency it is experiencing the same issue as Ethereum. If Immutable's core metrics are based around transactions, developing a solution for Bitcoin will increase their metrics and profitability. [^15]
