Immutable is an Australian-based start up that began its operations in 2018 and has seen huge success in both domestic and offshore markets. Started by two brothers, Robbie and James Ferguson and friend Alex Connolly, the company begain as a decentralised game designer that has gone on to become the leading global back-end for trading non-fungible tokens. The company first developed its first and now the highest grossing blockchain-backed video game, Gods Unchained, in 2018 where users "would trade and sell their cards freely, with the same level of ownership as if they were real tangible cards". 
Having seen huge success of this game and other Immutable developed games, Immutable somewhat pivited their focus and saw the need to firstly develop a marketplace to trade their game-oriented NFT's and other NFT projects and consequently develop out further Layer 2 Protocol on the Ethereum network to scale Ethereum projects. With the rise of Ethereum and gas fees which ultimately slowed down secondary trading in this space, the company has gone on to become the world leader in Layer 2 Protocol of the Ethereum network, developing solutions to efficently handle transactions and reduce gas and transaction times. 
Since its inception, Immutable has received large rounds funding from multiple Venture Capital funds and investors looking to develop web3 capabilities in Australia and overseas. Initial seed capital of $2.4 million from blockchain-focussed venture capital funds, Continue Capital and Nirvana Capital, helped the company develop out their first project and second round of funding in September 2019 saw blockchain focussed VC firms Galaxy Digital EOS VC fund and Nasper Ventures commit $15 million to support further development of their flagship game. Since their development of their own open-source blockchain platform, Immutable X, and it's linked Layer 2 Protocol software, the company has seen larger funding in the last 6 months of $82 million (Sept 2021) and $200 million (Mar 2022) from lead investors backed by Tencent, GameStop and other VC firms.

# Business Activities?
*What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?*

---

Ethereum is the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency and has gained popularity due to its compatability with developer's projects. Despite it's compatibility for smart contracts, dApps and speed in which it can verify contracts, it still exhibits some major problems which Immutable are looking to solve. These issues include high gas fees, high requirements of electricity to validate transactions and ultimately network congestion which is slowing down the execution of smart contracts which Ethereum is known for. While at first glance, Immutable X's website looks like it is just another marketplace, similar to the likes of OpenSea, it is their Layer 2 scaling solution that can link with  project is in place to ultimately support developers by making minting and transacting more efficient than running NFT projects directly on Ethereum. Immutable was the first to develop a Layer 2 scalling soution for NFTs on the Ethereum Network and this project was developed to solve this specific issue, promising zero gas fees for peer to peer trading, increased scalability with 9,000 trades per second, and ensuring all transactions are 100% carbon neutral.

*Who is the intended customer?*

*What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?*
Immutable have developed a type of Layer 2 solution called zero-knowledge roll up or ZK-Rollups, which essentually are data collateralised on the main chain that is transported off-chain for processing and computing. As data is stored off-chain and relevant data is requested less frequently, it saves considerable amounts of processing power and frees up the blockchain capacity used for transaction validation

*What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success?*

One of their main metrics used by Immutable is secondary market trading voume on their platform. Since inception, they have received 200 million in secondary trading volume and are looking to increase this over the next 12 months to 1.2 billion in trading volume (Source: Personal interview with Immutable employee). In order to reach this target, the company have done a lot in attracting strategic partners where their technology can be implimented, such as GameStop, where Immutable are developing an NFT marketplace with their Layer 2 functionality, as well as partnership arrangements with Universal Studios, musicians such as Travis Scott and a large list of other big gaming companies and high-touch corporates.

## Recommendations

A recent article written by Forbes this month suggesting the interest in NFT's and overall metaverses declining based on internet searches, many are commenting that that interest in these concepts are declining.

With a clear edge over any competitors in this space, the predominant risk that Immutable face is the the potential decline of the industry.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
